    Thank you for visiting my first webpage! I hope you will take some time to explore a bit here. 
    I don't know who you are, but In case you are looking for some insight on my current standing in the world of web development; here it is:
    I am currently seeking work in the web development field. 
    I have been actively working on building up my skills in html and css since 08/2020 with the help of my boyfriend (Mike Lyons. You can see his image icon on the tab. He is also the person who has inspired me to pursue a career in web development.).
    I may be just a novice but I am also an artist. My passions stem from anything that invokes creative inspiration, this is ultimately the core reason why I have chosen to become a web developer. 
    If you are someone who is looking to add to your current web development team, I would love to join you! Feel free to contact me if you would like to consider me. If not, I hope you will at least remember me and check back here in the future, as I will be actively working on this site.
    Thank you for visiting! I hope to hear from you soon.
