Paragard Copper InterUterineDevice (a personal experience):
I’m assuming if you have considered, or are currently considering, getting a copper iud installed; you’ve probably already looked up all the wonderful potential side effects and potential horrific pain involved in having it installed. I’ll tell you first-hand and foremost that having the paragard installed is completely unique to the individual and I do advise that you are in tune with your own unique cycle and body before having this installed. For example; if you are someone who experiences painful/heavy periods as a norm, I would advise not having this installed. Paragard causes inflammation (meaning a thicker uterine lining resulting in longer and/or heavier periods). If you are someone who experiences regular or irregular periods you may have a good/tolerable experience with paragard. 
As far as the insertion process is concerned; it all depends on what your pain tolerance is. (my experience wasn’t bad). For me, it didn’t feel any different than a menstrual cramp. 

I will emphasize again that paragard is unique to the individual. Your experience with paragard (if you choose/or have chosen paragard) may differ from my own. 

To any of the interested readers...Here’s my story: 
Back in August 2020 I took a pregnancy test that came up positive. In my fear and panic, I immediately called up planned parenthood to schedule an appointment to have a test done and a potential abortion. I stayed silent for most of the day avoiding telling my bf about it (he was working and we had only been dating for 3 months at the time). At the end of the day I finally decided to tell my boyfriend about the test. He obviously agreed that abortion was the right choice. I will admit that I had some conflicted feelings around the idea; but ultimately, in all condersiation, I knew that abortion was the best route. After a night of conflicting thoughts and feelings around the thought of rising a child in my situation and going through having an abortion; I woke up feeling resentful at my boyfriend for not being more emotionally supportive for what I was going through (he had spent the whole night ignoring the situation and playing video games). I, of course had to let these feelings go, as we had mutually decided that abortion would be the best course of action. He strongly advised that I should ask about having an IUD inserted as a form of birth control to prevent another pregnancy scare. (He had advised previously already that I should get an IUD, but I was not keen on the idea). 
I am someone who does not agree with taking synthetic hormones. So in my research for non-hormonal birth-control options, paragard(IUD) was the only effective and low maintenance option (as I am sure that you have also already come to find). Before my appointment, I began bleeding (YES! I’m not pregnant!). I went into my appointment anyway just to be sure. The pregnancy test that I took at planned parenthood came up negative (thank god). This scare, however, was enough to convince me to sign myself up to a more reliable birth-control method. In my appointment I scheduled a date to have the paragard inserted. I went home and researched more about various experiences with paragard and came to the conclusion that the only way to find out if paragard was really right for me was to try it out for myself. Early September, I went in to my appointment to have paragard inserted. I was very nervous (as you could imagine). The medical assistant who coached me through the process was very supportive and comforting which made the situation more bearable for me. I was SURE before going in that I was going to experience a lot of pain in having the IUD inserted. I had taken the “suggested” amount of ibuprofen (Suggested amount is 800mg. I took 400mg as I am on the smaller side. You may need more/less depending on what your own needs are. This is tied to being in tune with your own body). The insertion process done by the doctor was done effectively and professionally (be sure your doctor is experienced with IUD insertions). I took a deep breath in when the insertion of the IUD was happening, and a slow breath out as the doctor was “exiting”. The pain for me was no different than an intense menstrual cramp (it could be different for you depending on what your own cramping is like and what your own pain threshold is). After the insertion I could “feel” the IUD inside me (I could also just be on the sensitive side). I experienced a slight pinching feeling afterwards followed by heavy bleeding within 12 hours after the insertion. I’m going to be honest with you...the bleeding I experienced was foriegn to me. I’m not used to intensely heavy flows, so naturally I was alarmed by it. I bled heavily for 3 days, then the bleeding slowed and stopped after 5 days. About 10 days later, the insanely heavy bleeding started again, lasting around 6 days. After that my body seemed like it had adjusted to the IUD and I didn’t notice it as much. Everything was going smoothly for about 3 weeks, then I started bleeding AGAIN. This time the bleeding was lighter...but it wasn’t like a normal period for me. I had this very consistent mild on and off bleeding for 6 weeks until I decided that I couldn’t take it anymore and decided to have the IUD removed. Having the IUD removed was a much quicker process and less painful. After the removal I experienced some cramping and pain. I also noticed how inflammed the area surrounding the IUD had gotten. In short my experience with paragard was not really worth it in my opinion. It has been a full 24 hours now since I had it removed and I am still feeling inflammation from it. My body clearly did not want this device inside me and I am expecting it to take a week or two for my body to recover.
